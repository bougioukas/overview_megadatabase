The **OMG** Project stands for "**O**verviews: **M**ethodology and **G**uidance".
Part of the OMG project is the development of the **O**verviews **M**e**G**a-database (OMG-database).

This website presents the first database that contains a large number of healthcare overviews of reviews and their methodologies published in English, the **O**verviews **M**e**G**a-database (OMG-database). 
The database provides a comprehensive source that can be freely used by all researchers to easily identify overviews of reviews on a specific topic, to avoid duplication of effort and reduce research waste. 

The section Databases in the navigation menu includes:

1. The "Overviews Database", a list of overviews of interventions, associations, DTA, etc.

2. The "Methodological Overviews Database", a list of methodological overviews that are used to evaluate reliability, transparency, and reporting of reviews.

3. The "Guidance Database", a list of methodological papers relevant to overviews.

The databases will be regularly updated with new data and studies.
