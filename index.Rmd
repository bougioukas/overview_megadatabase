The **OMG** project stands for "**O**verviews: **M**ethodology and **G**uidance".

This website presents the first Database that contains a large number of healthcare overviews of reviews published in English. 
The database provides a comprehensive source that can be freely used by all researchers to easily identify overviews of reviews on a specific topic, to avoid duplication of effort and reduce research waste. 

Methodological papers relevant to overviews are included in the tab named "Methods Database".

The databases will be regularly updated with new data and studies.
